# Cross-Stich-Images-Vignette
This vignette describes the process of creating a cross-stitch pattern version of any PNG/JPEG image, using clustering analysis to simplify the image. 
The final result is a realistic cross-stitch pattern in a plot that has guiding gridelines and a legend showing the embroidery floss colours associated with the colours in the original image.
